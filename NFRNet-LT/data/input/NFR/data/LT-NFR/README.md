@LT-NFR

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This is a dataset of non-functional requirement descriptions called LT-NFR
%The whole dataset is constructed by filtering, screening, and reintegrating the data documents of 13 software requirements with new labels and descriptions of self-expanding NFRs.
%The LT-NFR dataset has a long-tailed distribution, which makes it suitable for investigating the challenges of categorising NFRs with long-tailed distributions.
